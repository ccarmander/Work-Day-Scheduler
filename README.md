# Work-Day-Scheduler

This week we had to make a Work Day Scheduler that allowed for a your day to well, be scheduled. It was to include your workday 
hours and to be able to save to your local storage and different colors pending on the time of the day. 

Upon opening the page you'll be right at the scheduler and depending on the hour it will indicate the color of the boxes. 

Brown Boxes = Past<br>
Orange Boxes = Present<br>
Gray Boxes = Future<br>

After figuring out what hour you need to schedule in, type in the box and hit the save icon on the right and it will save to local storage allowing 
you to refresh and your scheduled actiivity will still be there.
