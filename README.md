# Work-Day-Scheduler

This week we had to make a Work Day Scheduler that allowed for a your day to well, be scheduled. It was to include your workday 
hours and to be able to save to your local storage. 

Upon opening the page you'll be right at the scheduler and depending on the hour it will indicate the color of the boxes. 

Brown Boxes = Past<br>
Orange Boxes = Present<br>
Gray Boxes = Future<br>
